            Mike Hirsch started the online shop in 2002 in his garage and grew
            the shop into a full-blown online skateshop over the first 4 years,
            and in 2009, opened our retail flagship store in Mission Viejo, CA.
            In 2010 we expanded to to include a new warehouse next to our retail
            store to improve our stock. Currently, we have 10,000 sq. ft. of
            retail, warehouse and office space to better serve our customers and
            bring you the best selection of any skateboard shop around the
            world!

            Since 2002, SoCal has processed hundreds of thousands of orders and
            we have built a solid reputation domestically in the USA and around
